### Standard Java exceptions



* **Throwable** includes two general types, one is **Error** and the other is **Exception**.   
  **Exception** is the basic type thrown by any method and your own methods or runtime accidents.  
  **Error* represents compile-time and system errors, usually you don't worry about catching them.
