##What is the Internet  
1. **Application Programming Interface** (API) is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination program.  
**EXAMPLE**: Alice must write Bob’s full name, address, and zip code in the center of the envelope; seal the envelope; put a stamp in the upper-right-hand corner of the envelope; and finally, drop the envelope into an official postal service mailbox. Then the mail would be sent to Bob. That manner is similar to API.

2. In a **protocol**, there are specific messages we send, and specific actions we take in response to the received reply messages or other events.   
A **protocol** defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.  
##Network Edge
3. **End Systems** are called like that because they sit at the edge of the internet. They include desktop computers, servers and mobile computers. They are also referred as **hosts** because they host application programs. **Hosts** are sometimes divided into two categories: **clients** and **servers**.  

4. Access Networks  
For home access, the two most prevalent types are digital subscriber line(DSL) and cable.  
(1)DSL  
![DSL Internet Access](https://github.com/adrrrrrrrian/ReadingNotes/blob/master/Computer%20Networking-%20A%20Top-Down%20Approach/Fig%201.1%20DSL%20Internet%20Access.PNG)   
The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, which makes the single DSL link appear as if there were three seperate links, so that a telephone call and an Internet connection can share the DSL link at the same time. (It's the technique of **frequency division multiplexing**)  
**NOTICE**: downstream channel typically allocate a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel.  
(2)Cable internet access  
Different from DSL which uses telco's existing local telephone infrastructure, cable internet access uses cable television company's existing cable television infrastructure.  
**NOTICE**: Cable internet access is a shared broadcast medium.  
For **enterprise access**, a local area network is used to connect end systems to the router.  
Ethernet network is the most prevalent access technology. With Ethernet, users typically can get 100Mbps access to the Ethernet switch, servers may get more than 1Gbps access.  
For wireless LAN access, it is based on IEEE 802.11 technology.
