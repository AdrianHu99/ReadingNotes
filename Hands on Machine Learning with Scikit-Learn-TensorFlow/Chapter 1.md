1. Type of machine learning
        Supervised learning: the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, like spam filter.
                linear/logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision trees and random forests, neural networks...
        
        Unsupervised learning: The system tries to learn without a teacher.
                Clustering, Visualization and dimensionality reduction, Association rule learning
