This is the reading note for the book <<Head First in Design Patterns>>.

I am also learning design patterns with the "Design Pattern Video Tutorials" by Derek Banas (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHpsC5ng_E&list=PLF206E906175C7E07&index=1) and the code from the website (http://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/).
